# Detailed Description
Instantly generate a JSON resume export from a LinkedIn profile page. Simply navigate to a LinkedIn profile that you have access to, click the extension, and click the "profile to json" export button. A modal should popup with the export within seconds.

This is a quick project I threw together, mostly out of frustration that it didn’t already exist. As I outline in the “readme” file in my Github repo for this project, I wanted to export my LinkedIn profile to JSON Resume, which is an exciting standard for storing, sharing, parsing, and generating resumes based on a shared underlying data structure, or schema.

The official LinkedIn APIs are restrictive and require an approval process, and the manual data export option offered by LinkedIn can take up to 72 hours. I was frustrated by this fact, so I built this tool to instantly export a LinkedIn profile page to the JSON Resume standard, which appears in a little popup modal that you can easily copy and paste out of.
